# Performance evaluation of AutoML frameworks vs Conventional strategies

Designing architectures for machine learning networks can be challenging. Our goal is to understand and evaluate the AutoML tools and compare them against the traditional machine learning model building methods. We have evaluated the efficacy of employing AutoML frameworks in a real world scenario and compared its results against the conventional strategy of a person of Data Science knowledge building the machine learning pipeline himself. We gain knowledge from the metrics and investigate the best method and tool to use for training any machine learning model. 

## Approaches
We have looked into 4 autoML systems namely, Auto-sklearn (Feurer et al., 2019), Google Cloud AutoML (Google), H20 (H2O.ai, 2017) and TPot and build the system to tackle Classification problems.  At each step of the machine learning pipeline we have focused on the metrics to look into while implementing an AutoML model and compare it against its corresponding counterpart in the conventional or traditional strategy.
